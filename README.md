# flights 🛫💺✈️🛬

The idea behind this app is rather simple: Enter the IATA-code of a flight and get information about the flight/aircraft/airport...

It's basically a small version of the [FlightAware](http://de.flightaware.com/mobile/)/[FlightRadar24](https://itunes.apple.com/app/flightradar24-pro/id382069612?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)/... iOS-apps, not a real competitor, but a little spare time project. I'm not even sure, if this thing will ever hit the App store. My motivation to do this is pretty simple: I just like planes.

It's written in Swift and uses MBProgressHUD and Carthage so far. I consider myself still a beginner, so don't judge me too hard The data comes from Flightradar24, so go and download their app instead of using this thingy. It's much better from every possible perspective.
