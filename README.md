# flights 🛫💺✈️🛬

The idea behind this app is rather simple: Enter the IATA-code of a flight and get information about the flight/aircraft/airport...

It's basically a small version of the [FlightAware](http://de.flightaware.com/mobile/)/[FlightRadar24](https://itunes.apple.com/app/flightradar24-pro/id382069612?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D4)/... iOS-apps, not a real competitor, but a little spare time project. I'm not even sure, if this thing will ever hit the App store. My motivation to do this is pretty simple: I just like planes.

It's written in Swift and uses MBProgressHUD and Carthage so far. The data comes from Flightradar24, so go and download their app instead of using this thingy. It's much better from every possible perspective.

If you have any questions, [send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/zeitschlag) or open an issue. I consider myself still a beginner, so feel free to criticize the code. Hopefully I learn something here ;)
